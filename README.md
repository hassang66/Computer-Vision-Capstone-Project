## 🛠️ Metal Surface Defect Detection – GC10 Dataset

This project leverages a YOLOv8 object detection model to identify **metal surface defects** from the **GC10 dataset**, which includes 10 common defect types in industrial components. The trained model is integrated into a user-friendly **Streamlit web app**, allowing real-time predictions on uploaded images.

### 🔍 Features

* 📦 Trained on the GC10 dataset (YOLO-format annotations)
* 🔎 Detects and localizes 10 classes of surface defects
* 🖼️ Streamlit web app for live inference
* 💾 Model checkpoints saved and resumable from Google Drive/GitHub
* 📊 Confidence-based predictions displayed with bounding boxes

### 🚀 Try it Live

Upload your image and let the model tell you what defect it sees!
